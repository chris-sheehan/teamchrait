  <h3>The Bride</h3>
	<p>Caitlin is a human being who was born and raised in suburban Detroit, attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor (GO BLUE), and moved to Brooklyn with no plan in 2008. Through that lack of a plan she somehow found immensely satisfying professional work in medical communications, friends unmatched in wit and kindness, the best/worst dog (but definitely cutest), and, now, a husband. She enjoys normal person things like fun, traveling, cooking, chocolate, food-scented candles, and reading, but really, really loves exercising (anything with kettlebells), structure and routine, spontaneity, reading scientific literature, spending time with her whip-smart nieces, eating foods and sauces so hot they make her cry, all the coffee, the color black, karaoke, games of deception, grit, and reason.</p>
  <h3>The Groom</h3>
  <p>
Chris is also a human being, though born and raised in the Bay Area and attended UC San Diego (GO TRITONS?). He moved to Brooklyn around the same time as Caitlin and somehow is still there. He likes data and he likes sports and he doesn't care who knows.

  <h3>The Dog</h3>
	<p>Khaleesi "Leesi" is a 4-year-old rescue pup from the Brooklyn Animal Resource Coalition in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Leesi can open doors, high five, roll over, and do that thing where she balances food on her nose until you tell her to get it. She abhors fetch but adores tug, refuses to go outside when it's even slightly raining, and spans three octaves when vocalizing.</p>
  <h3>How We Met</h3>
	<p>Chris and Caitlin met through mutual friends in the Summer of 2008 at Spike Hill (RIP) in Williamsburg. Initial banter eventually grew into enduring affection and respect. They started dating in 2009 and have been together since.</p>
  <h3>How We Decided to Make it Official</h3>
	<p>On a cold Friday night in November 2016, Chris and Caitlin took Leesi on a walk to Sunset Park, one of the highest points in Brooklyn. While standing looking out at the New York City skyline, Chris stammered incoherently for a minute before eventually popping the question to a stunned Caitlin, who mulled it over for a few seconds and then enthusiastically agreed! Leesi also agreed it was a great idea.</p>
